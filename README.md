Addify is a Firefox extension which allows you to quickly search and add songs to your Spotify library that you find on Youtube. The extension only works with a Youtube video opened. Clicking on the extension icon in your tool bar will display song results from Spotify(if any). The popup will display up to 3 songs. Clicking the plus sign on the right hand side of the popup will add the song to your Liked Songs playlist.
